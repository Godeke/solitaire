# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The solitaire game collection has comprehensive unit tests that are currently failing due to mock configuration issues, missing exports, and component integration problems. We need to systematically fix these test failures to achieve 100% pass rate while maintaining the existing functionality and test coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Mock Export Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all module mocks to properly export the functions and classes that the actual modules export, so that tests can run without import/export errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests import `withPerformanceLogging` from UIActionLogger THEN the mock SHALL provide this export
2. WHEN tests import `AudioManager` class from AudioManager module THEN the mock SHALL provide the constructor
3. WHEN tests import `initializeAudioManager` from AudioManager module THEN the mock SHALL provide this function
4. WHEN tests import any function from mocked modules THEN the mock SHALL provide all expected exports
5. WHEN mocks are created THEN they SHALL match the actual module's export structure

### Requirement 2: Fix UIActionLogger Mock Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UIActionLogger mock to provide all necessary functions and maintain singleton behavior, so that components using performance logging work correctly in tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components call `withPerformanceLogging` THEN the mock SHALL execute the wrapped function
2. WHEN components access UIActionLogger instance THEN the mock SHALL provide consistent singleton behavior
3. WHEN tests verify logging calls THEN the mock SHALL track and provide access to logged events
4. WHEN components use drag/drop logging THEN the mock SHALL provide appropriate mock responses

### Requirement 3: Fix AudioManager Mock Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AudioManager mock to provide complete class functionality and global functions, so that audio-related tests pass without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests instantiate `new AudioManager()` THEN the mock SHALL provide a working constructor
2. WHEN tests call `getAudioManager()` THEN the mock SHALL return a consistent singleton instance
3. WHEN tests call `initializeAudioManager()` THEN the mock SHALL create and return a new instance
4. WHEN AudioManager methods are called THEN the mock SHALL provide appropriate mock responses
5. WHEN tests verify audio functionality THEN the mock SHALL track method calls appropriately

### Requirement 4: Fix Component Test Integration Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component tests to properly handle game engine integration and UI interactions, so that component behavior is accurately tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GameManager tests render unimplemented games THEN they SHALL find the expected placeholder elements
2. WHEN CardRenderer tests simulate clicks THEN the logging system SHALL capture the events
3. WHEN WinAnimation tests run THEN they SHALL properly handle DropZone component integration
4. WHEN drag-drop tests execute THEN they SHALL work with the mocked react-dnd system

### Requirement 5: Fix Test Setup and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test setup to provide consistent and complete mocking environment, so that all tests have the dependencies they need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN all required global objects SHALL be properly mocked
2. WHEN tests use localStorage THEN the mock SHALL provide complete Storage interface
3. WHEN tests use performance timers THEN the mock SHALL provide consistent timing behavior
4. WHEN tests access window objects THEN all required properties SHALL be available
5. WHEN tests run in different environments THEN the setup SHALL work consistently

### Requirement 6: Maintain Test Coverage and Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix test failures without reducing test coverage or changing test intentions, so that the test suite remains comprehensive and valuable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are fixed THEN the total number of test cases SHALL remain the same or increase
2. WHEN mocks are updated THEN they SHALL still verify the intended behavior
3. WHEN test fixes are applied THEN no existing passing tests SHALL break
4. WHEN all fixes are complete THEN the test pass rate SHALL be 100%
5. WHEN tests verify component behavior THEN they SHALL still test the actual component logic
