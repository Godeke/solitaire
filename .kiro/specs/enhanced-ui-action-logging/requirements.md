# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves enhancing the existing logging system in the Solitaire Game Collection to provide comprehensive UI action logging for debugging game state issues. The enhancement will add detailed logging for all user interactions, drag-and-drop operations, and game state changes to help identify and debug issues that occur during gameplay.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging of all UI interactions, so that I can debug game state issues by analyzing the sequence of user actions that led to the problem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs any drag-and-drop operation THEN the system SHALL log the complete drag operation including source position, target position, card details, and validation results
2. WHEN a user clicks on any interactive element THEN the system SHALL log the click event with element details and current game state context
3. WHEN a card move is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the move attempt with before/after game state snapshots
4. WHEN a move is validated THEN the system SHALL log the validation result with detailed reasoning
5. THE system SHALL log all UI interactions with sufficient detail to recreate the exact sequence of events

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured game state logging, so that I can track how the game state changes in response to user actions and identify where state corruption occurs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any game state change occurs THEN the system SHALL log a complete state snapshot with timestamp
2. WHEN a move is executed THEN the system SHALL log both the previous and new game states
3. WHEN cards are automatically moved THEN the system SHALL log the auto-move operation with triggering conditions
4. WHEN game rules are applied THEN the system SHALL log the rule evaluation process and results
5. THE system SHALL maintain a chronological log of all state changes for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed drag-and-drop operation logging, so that I can debug issues with card movement and drop zone validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a drag operation starts THEN the system SHALL log the drag initiation with card details and source position
2. WHEN a card is dragged over a drop zone THEN the system SHALL log the hover event with validation status
3. WHEN a drop operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log the drop attempt with target validation results
4. WHEN a drag operation is cancelled THEN the system SHALL log the cancellation reason and card return
5. THE system SHALL log all intermediate drag states for complete operation tracing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and timing information in logs, so that I can identify performance bottlenecks and timing-related issues in the UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any UI operation completes THEN the system SHALL log the operation duration
2. WHEN animations are triggered THEN the system SHALL log animation start/end times
3. WHEN game state updates occur THEN the system SHALL log the update processing time
4. WHEN rendering operations happen THEN the system SHALL log render performance metrics
5. THE system SHALL provide timing context for all logged operations to identify performance issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replay a game from a log either in its entirety or up to a specific step, so that I can debug UI actions by recreating the exact game state and allowing tests or manual debugging to continue from that point.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a log is provided to the game THEN the system SHALL reconstruct the game state from the logged UI actions
2. WHEN a log replay is initiated THEN the system SHALL auto-play through all logged UI actions to recreate the final state
3. WHEN a log is provided with a specific step number THEN the system SHALL auto-play up to that step and stop for debugging
4. WHEN log replay completes THEN tests or manual debugging SHALL be able to continue from the recreated game state
5. THE system SHALL support both full replay and partial replay for targeted debugging of specific game states
