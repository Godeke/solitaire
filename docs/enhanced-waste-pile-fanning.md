# Enhanced Waste Pile Fanning Feature

## Overview

The waste pile in Klondike solitaire now features realistic card fanning that spreads cards to the right, mimicking how cards would naturally be laid out in physical solitaire games.

## Visual Design

### Fanning Effect
- Cards fan out horizontally to the right with 18px spacing between each card
- Each card has a slight rotation (2° increments) for natural appearance
- Transform origin set to "bottom left" for realistic pivoting
- Up to 3 visible fanned cards behind the top card

### Enhanced Styling
- Subtle shadows (0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)) for depth
- Light blue-gray gradient background for better visibility against green felt
- White border highlights for enhanced contrast
- Smooth transitions for all transformations
- Increased waste pile width to accommodate fanned layout

## Technical Implementation

### Transform Properties
```css
transform: translateX(${(index + 1) * 18}px) rotate(${(index + 1) * 2}deg)
transformOrigin: 'bottom left'
```

### Layout Adjustments
- Waste pile width: `calc(var(--card-width, 80px) + 60px)`
- Count badge positioned relative to rightmost fanned card
- Flex alignment set to `flex-start` for proper card positioning

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Realistic Appearance**: Mimics physical solitaire card layout
2. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Easy to see how many cards are in the waste pile
3. **Intuitive Understanding**: Players immediately understand the 3-card draw mechanic
4. **Professional Polish**: Adds sophistication to the game interface
5. **Spatial Awareness**: Helps players track their progress through the deck

## Performance Considerations

- Only renders up to 3 fanned cards regardless of actual stack size
- Uses CSS transforms for hardware acceleration
- Minimal DOM elements for optimal performance
- Smooth transitions without impacting game responsiveness

## Responsive Design

- Fanning effect scales with card size variables
- Layout automatically adjusts for different screen sizes
- Maintains proper spacing ratios across devices
- Count badge positioning adapts to fanned card layout

## Comparison: Stock vs Waste Pile

| Feature | Stock Pile | Waste Pile |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Layout | Stacked (diagonal offset) | Fanned (horizontal spread) |
| Rotation | None | 2° increments |
| Spacing | 2px diagonal | 18px horizontal |
| Visual Effect | Depth stacking | Realistic fanning |
| Purpose | Show remaining cards | Show drawn cards sequence |

This enhancement makes the waste pile visualization much more intuitive and visually appealing, clearly showing players the sequence of drawn cards in a natural, familiar layout.
